## Solutions

- Proxy:
  - A reverse proxy is the application that sits in front of back-end applications and forwards client (e.g. browser) requests to those applications. Reverse proxies help increase scalability, performance, resilience and security. The resources returned to the client appear as if they originated from the web server itself.
  - Large websites and content delivery networks use reverse proxies, together with other techniques, to balance the load between internal servers. Reverse proxies can keep a cache of static content, which further reduces the load on these internal servers and the internal network. It is also common for reverse proxies to add features such as compression or TLS encryption to the communication channel between the client and the reverse proxy.
- TLS 1.2:
  - As a cryptographic protocol, Transport Layer Security encrypts data and authenticates connections when moving data over the internet via HTTPâ€”an extension of the protocol known as HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure). When a user visits a website, their browser checks for a TLS certificate on the site. If one is present, their browser performs a TLS handshake to check its validity and authenticate the server. Once

- Health checks:

  - ELB HEALTH CHECKS:
    - An Elastic Load Balancer only routes traffic to healthy targets such as EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, microservices, Lambda functions, and appliances. With Elastic Load Balancing, you get improved insight into the health of your applications in two ways: (1) health check improvements that allow you to configure detailed error codes. The health checks allow you to monitor the health of each of your services behind the the load balancer; and (2) new metrics that give insight into traffic for each of the services running on an EC2 instance.
