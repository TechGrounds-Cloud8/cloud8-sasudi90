## One Sentence summary of the day
Read better even if it's dry.

## Challenges
- creating a bucket attached to an instance was no problem
- I thought s3deploy. was meant to be used for hosting a website only! Didn't read good enough AND I was working in the wrong dir....

## Solutions
1. #create s3 bucket
        bucket = s3.Bucket(
            self, 
            "postdeploybucketau",
            bucket_name="postdeploybucketau",
            removal_policy=aws_cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
            auto_delete_objects=True,
        )

2. #put the scripts in dir postdeploymentscripts into s3 bucket
        s3deploy.BucketDeployment(
            self,
            "postdeploytest",
            sources=[s3deploy.Source.asset('./postdeploymentscripts')],
            destination_bucket=bucket,
        )
