# [Git en Github introduction]
Setting up Git and Github
---
<br>

## Key terminology
[git: an open source, distributed version-control system <br>
GitHub: a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories <br>
Repository = A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.<br>
Main / Master = "master" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch. This means that "master" can be seen as a repository's "default" branch.<br>
Branch = Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.<br>
Commit = a Git object, a snapshot of your entire repository compressed into a SHA<br>
Push / Pull = If you have a code change in your repository, and want to move it to a target repository, then: "Push" is you forcing the changes being present in the target repository ( git push ). "Pull" is the target repository grabbing your changes to be present there ( git pull from the other repo)<br>
Merge = The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.<br>
Fork = a copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user]

2. https://git-scm.com/book/nl/v2/Aan-de-slag-Wat-is-Git%3F
<br>

### Overcome challanges
Challenges were the meaning of the keywords. Looked it up and went my way. Github Desktop made the implementation of these keywords/commands alot easier. 

### Results
[Describe here the result of the exercise. An image can speak more than a thousand words, include one when this wisdom applies.]
