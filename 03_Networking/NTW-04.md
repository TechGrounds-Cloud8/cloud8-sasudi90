# Binary and hex
Study binary en hexadecimal counting, in particular counting in base 2 and 16.

## Key terminology
- base 2: The binary number system, in mathematics, positional numeral system has 2 as the base and so requiring only two different symbols for its digits, 0 and 1, instead of the usual 1 - 10 needed in the decimal system. 
- base 16: The hexadecimal system (shortly hex), uses the number 16 as its base (radix). As a base-16 numeral system, it uses 16 symbols. These are the 10 decimal digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the first six letters of the English alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F).
