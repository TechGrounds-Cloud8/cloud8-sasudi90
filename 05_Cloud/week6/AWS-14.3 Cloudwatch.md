### Overcome challenges
- None, have been looking at CloudWatch monitoring several times for assignements. 

### Results
1. Made an EC2 instance with a load test web server. CPU Usage can be seen in next image. ![](../../00_includes/AWS/AWS-14.3/CPUgebruik.png)
2. Made an alarm if CPU > 99%![](../../00_includes/AWS/AWS-14.3/alarminEC2.png)
3. Alarm with CPU Threshold![](../../00_includes/AWS/AWS-14.3/alarmuh.png)
