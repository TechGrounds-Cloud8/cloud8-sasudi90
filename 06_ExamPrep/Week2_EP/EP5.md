- **internet of things (IoT)**: describes the network of physical objects— 'things' —that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet 

- **block device mappings**: A block device mapping defines the block devices (instance store volumes and EBS volumes) to attach to an instance. You can specify a block device mapping as part of creating an AMI so that the mapping is used by all instances launched from the AMI

- **message broker**: translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver

- **ARN**: Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) uniquely identify AWS resources. ARN is used to reference a specific resource when you orchestrate a system involving multiple AWS resources. For example, you have an API Gateway listening for RESTful APIs and invoking the corresponding Lambda function based on the API path and request method. The routing looks like the following

- **AWS step functions**: This service helps to watch the app performance via a graphical console. It’s easy to monitor processes as single work unites inside the app. You can choose from many use cases, such as calling Lambda to perform certain tasks, starting virtual machine learning, or creating automated workflows.

- **Amazon API Gateway**: is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications

- **Amazon SageMaker**: is a fully-managed service that enables data scientists and developers to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. Amazon SageMaker includes modules that can be used together or independently to build, train, and deploy your machine learning models

- **Amazon MQ**: is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers on AWS. Amazon MQ reduces your operational responsibilities by managing the provisioning, setup, and maintenance of message brokers for you. Because Amazon MQ connects to your current applications with industry-standard APIs and protocols, you can easily migrate to AWS without having to rewrite code

- **AWS Managed VPN**: AWS Virtual Private Network solutions establish secure connections between your on-premises networks, remote offices, client devices, and the AWS global network. AWS VPN is comprised of two services: AWS Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN. Each service provides a highly-available, managed, and elastic cloud VPN solution to protect your network traffic.
    - AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates encrypted tunnels between your network and your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds or AWS Transit Gateways. 
    - For managing remote access, AWS Client VPN connects your users to AWS or on-premises resources using a VPN software client.

- **Amazon Comprehend**: is a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover valuable insights and connections in text.
  
- **AWS IoT Core**:  lets you connect billions of IoT devices and route trillions of messages to AWS services without managing infrastructure.

- **Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF)**: makes it easy to build applications that coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your application. Coordinating tasks across the application involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.

- **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**: is a cost-effective, flexible, and scalable email service that enables developers to send mail from within any application. You can configure Amazon SES quickly to support several email use cases, including transactional, marketing, or mass email communications. Amazon SES's flexible IP deployment and email authentication options help drive higher deliverability and protect sender reputation, while sending analytics measure the impact of each email..
  
- **Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**: is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10 times performance improvement—from milliseconds to microseconds—even at millions of requests per second.

- **Amazon Lightsail**: provides easy-to-use cloud resources to get your web application or websites up and running in just a few clicks. Lightsail offers simplified services such as instances, containers, databases, storage, and more. 
  
- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)**: is integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), which means you can easily store and run container images for applications with either orchestrator.
